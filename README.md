# QA Thinking & Validation Portfolio

This repository represents my approach to Quality Assurance, focusing on
how I analyze applications, identify risk areas, and validate functionality,
APIs, and data from a real-world business perspective.  
The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical QA skills, structured
testing thinking, and continuous learning.

---

## Core QA Skill Set
- Functional & Manual Testing (Web Applications)
- Test Case Design & Execution
- Negative, Boundary & Edge Case Testing
- API Testing using Postman
- API Automation Execution using Newman
- Bug Reporting with Severity & Business Impact
- SQL-based Data Validation
- Agile / Scrum QA Practices

---

## How I Approach Testing
- Understand business requirements and user workflows before testing
- Identify high-risk and frequently used functionalities
- Focus on negative, boundary, and exception scenarios
- Validate consistency across UI, API responses, and data
- Report defects clearly with impact on end users and business

---

## Areas I Validate
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Input validations and error handling
- API response structure and status codes
- Data integrity and mismatch scenarios
- Role-based access and permission controls
- User experience and usability issues
